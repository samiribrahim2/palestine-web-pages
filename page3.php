  </header>
  <main>
    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Palestinian issue is one of the most prominent political issues of the modern world. It represents a
        complex model of the conflict between the right to self-determination and occupation. The issue arose
        from complex historical, political, and religious factors that have roots extending over centuries and
        has witnessed important developments that have influenced its course to this day.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Historical Roots</h2>
      <p>The roots of the Palestinian issue go back to the historical and religious significance of the land of
        Palestine. Palestine has been a center for the three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and
        Islam. In modern times, its strategic and political importance emerged with the expansion of European
        colonialism in the region.</p>
      <article>
        <h3>The British Mandate and the Beginning of the Problem</h3>
        <p>Following World War I, Palestine was placed under British mandate according to the Sykes-Picot
          Agreement (1916) and the Balfour Declaration (1917), in which Britain pledged to support the
          establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. This promise led to a large
          wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine, causing concern among Palestinian Arabs who felt their
          existence and identity were threatened.</p>

      <h2>Developments of the Palestinian Issue</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>The 1948 Nakba</h3>
        <p>In 1948, the State of Israel was declared following UN Resolution 181, which called for the partition
          of Palestine into two states: Arab and Jewish. Palestinians and Arabs rejected the resolution, and
          the 1948 War broke out, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from
          their lands in what is known as the Nakba (catastrophe).</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>The 1967 Naksa and Occupation</h3>
        <p>During the 1967 War, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, exacerbating the
          suffering of the Palestinian people and worsening the crisis. These occupied areas became central to
          the Palestinian demand for independence and statehood.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Peace Agreements</h3>
        <p>The Palestinian issue witnessed numerous attempts at peaceful settlement, starting with the Madrid
          Conference (1991) and followed by the Oslo Accords (1993), which provided for the establishment of a
          temporary Palestinian Authority and negotiations on final status issues. However, these agreements
          failed to meet Palestinian aspirations for full independence.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Current Situation</h2>
      <p>The Palestinian issue remains a major challenge for the international community. Palestinians suffer from
        Israeli occupation, which includes settlement construction, house demolitions, and an economic blockade
        on Gaza. At the same time, internal divisions within Palestinian leadership hinder efforts toward
        national unity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Geopolitical Importance of Palestine</h2>
      <p>Palestine holds great significance not only because of its historical, cultural, and religious
        background, but also due to its geopolitical location. Situated at the crossroads of Africa and Asia,
        its importance has drawn the attention of empires and foreign powers throughout history, including the
        Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans. In modern times, the land of Palestine is seen as a strategic location
        by various international actors, further complicating the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>The Role of International Organizations</h2>
      <p>The United Nations, the European Union, and various non-governmental organizations play crucial roles in
        the ongoing Palestinian issue. The UN has passed numerous resolutions, including those related to the
        recognition of Palestine as a state, and the protection of Palestinian human rights under occupation.
        However, the effectiveness of these international efforts is frequently questioned, especially when
        confronted with the political dynamics at play.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Palestinian Cultural Heritage</h2>
      <p>Palestinian culture is rich and diverse, with a deep connection to its land and history. From ancient
        traditions to modern-day art, literature, and cuisine, Palestinians have maintained a strong sense of
        identity despite years of adversity. The preservation of cultural heritage is not just about art and
        history; it is a form of resistance against occupation and a means of reaffirming national identity and
        unity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>The Role of Youth in the Palestinian Struggle</h2>
      <p>The youth of Palestine play an essential role in the struggle for independence and freedom. With limited
        opportunities for employment and political participation due to occupation, Palestinian youth have
        become a symbol of resilience. Many young Palestinians are involved in activism, advocacy, and
        international campaigns, while also focusing on creating change through education and technology.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="text-box">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The Palestinian issue remains a central humanitarian and political matter that requires a just solution
        guaranteeing the Palestinian people their right to self-determination and the establishment of their
        independent state. This requires unified international efforts and political will to achieve a just and
        comprehensive peace.</p>
